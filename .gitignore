# --- General Ignores (common for Python/ML projects) ---
.DS_Store               # macOS system files
.env                    # Python virtual environments (if you use one)
.venv/                  # Python virtual environments (if you use one)
__pycache__/            # Python bytecode cache
*.pyc                   # Compiled Python files
*.log                   # Log files
*.swp                   # Vim swap files
*~                      # Emacs backup files

# --- Jupyter Notebook Specific Ignores ---
.ipynb_checkpoints/     # Jupyter's auto-save checkpoints
# If your notebook outputs images directly into the folder, you might need to ignore them
*.png
*.jpg

# --- Machine Learning Specific Ignores (if they exist separately from notebook) ---
# It's less likely these exist as separate files if everything is in one .ipynb,
# but include them if you save large model weights or data outside the notebook.
trained_models/         # General folder for models
*.h5                    # Keras models
*.pth                   # PyTorch models
*.pt                    # PyTorch models
*.onnx                  # ONNX models
*.pb                    # TensorFlow protobuf files
checkpoints/            # Specific folder for model checkpoints
runs/                   # TensorBoard / Weights & Biases runs

# --- Large Datasets (VERY IMPORTANT to ignore if you have them locally) ---
# Do NOT upload raw or large processed datasets. Provide download instructions instead.
# Add the specific folder name where your monkey images/data are stored locally.
# Example:
10_Monkey_Species
F_MNIST_Data
runs
10_Monkey_Species.zip
grad_computation_graph_m2
m1_pytorch.ipynb
m2_Autograd_and_Backprop.ipynb
